## Chapter Template [DRAFT]
Each chapter should have the following sections:

| Section  | Description |
|  --------|-------------|
|Intended audience | The chapters will cover heterogeous and not necessarily overlapping target audiences; therefore please include a short description to ensure readers' time is wisely spent. |
|Why this is important| Description of the problem and vision for what best practices will address or make possible|
| Takeaway List | A bulleted list of things you can read and implement (similar to top 10 PLoS Top 10 articles). 
| Deep dive into takeaways | Each item should include specific examples that demonstrate that practice XYZ is possible and offer some insight as to why doing it one way (vs. another) is better. |
|Lessons learned / summary | This section is optional but encouraged in chapters where the source of truth for the majority of the content is external (Incorporated here by reference only) | 
| Acknowledgements | Key sources and or contributors. Note that references are most easily incorporated as hyperlinks rather than footnotes.|
