# Chapter 9: Sharing Educational Resources

## Intended audience	

*Educators at CTSAs who want to build a community of learners around their educational material.*

## Current version / status	



## Guidance 

*tbd, but some indication of whether the draft is early, actively soliciting comments, or ready to implement*

## Lessons learned / summary	

*This section is optional but encouraged in chapters where the source of truth for the majority of the content is external (Incorporated here by reference only)*

## Why this is important	

Keeping educational resources up to date and discoverable is difficult for single sites. In addition, sites reproducing educational material that is already made is wasteful and ignores the possibility of building educational communities around such resources.

One alternative that exists is providing collective ownership, such as the model for The Carpentries (Software, Data, and Library Carpentry), or the R for Data Science learning community. Hundreds, if not thousands of educators have tested, honed, and improved the lesson material for these groups. 

Additionally, a learning community provides an opportunity for those with intermediate skills to improve their knowledge and practice. 

## Status and feedback mechanisms	

*What stage is it in the development process? (See options below). Description and links for how people can comment, or contribute -- whether via Google form or GitHub issue etc.*

## Takeaway List	

*A bulleted list of things you can read and implement (similar to top 10 PLoS Top 10 articles).*

# Deep dive into takeaways	

Each item should include specific examples that demonstrate that practice XYZ is possible and offer some insight and evidence as to why doing it one way (vs. another) is better.
