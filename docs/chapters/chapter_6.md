# Chapter 6: Clinical Data Harmonization

## Intended audience

CTSA Informatics Leads and their staff seeking to harmonize their clinical data. The Sustainability and Change Management Task Team(SCM) of the Clinical Data Harmonization Working Group aims to aggregate, develop, curate, and disseminate content and tools that help encourage and guide organizationsâ€™ understanding of and investments in data harmonization efforts.

## Why is this important?

Clinical data is among the most valuable artifacts among CTSA hubs.  Appropriately leveraging that data for translational research, while respecting privacy and honoring hub autonomy, will advance CTSA goals and demonstrate our power as a network. The HL7 FHIR standard makes it possible for hubs to develop a next-generation repository that is truly integration-ready, whether directly for federated query or for transformation to any number of common standards.
