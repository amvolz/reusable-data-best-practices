# Chapter 3: Sharing Educational Resources

## Intended audience	

Educators at CTSAs who want to build a community of learners around their educational material, or make their educational materials discoverable and usable by others.

## Current version / status	



## Guidance 

*tbd, but some indication of whether the draft is early, actively soliciting comments, or ready to implement*

## Lessons learned / summary	

- Making educational resources *discoverable* requires publishing metadata about that resource
- Understanding whether a resource is open or not affects what metadata should be published
- Inviting other instructors and learners to utilize and update educational resources builds an educational community
- Educational communities have multiple benefits beyond keeping course material up to date

## Why this is important	

Keeping educational resources both *discoverable* and *up to date* is difficult for single CTSA sites.

### Discoverability

Making an educational resource *discoverable* is of vital importance. Sites replicating educational material that already exists is ultimately a poor use of resources. Such replication largely ignores the possibility of building educational communities around such resources.

Discoverability may be done for multiple reasons: 

1. to advertise that an educational resource exists so others may take the course, 
2. whether a course is appropriate to *reuse*, *repurpose*, or *remix*, and has additional resources to aid other instructors in adopting the material.

### Keeping Material Updated

One alternative to a single site maintaining an education resource is providing *collective ownership* to a learning community, such as the model for [The Carpentries](http://carpentries.org/) (Software, Data, and Library Carpentry), or the [R for Data Science](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) learning community. Hundreds, if not thousands of educators have tested, honed, and improved the lesson material for these groups. Collective ownership of the learning material makes the material stronger and more applicable to a wide range of learners. Additionally, the learning community that results from such collective ownership provides an opportunity for those with intermediate skills to improve their knowledge and practice this knowledge in a safe and supportive environment. 

## Status and feedback mechanisms	

*What stage is it in the development process? (See options below). Description and links for how people can comment, or contribute -- whether via Google form or GitHub issue etc.*

## Takeaway List	

1. Make metadata available by publishing metadata using a standard such as *MIER* or *Harper Lite*
2. Add metadata that encourages reuse of your educational resource
3. Encourage the formation of or join an education community to form around an educational resource by encouraging reuse of your educational material beyond your center.
4. Foster growth and updates of your material through quarterly hackathons or sprints

## Deep dive into takeaways	

*Each item should include specific examples that demonstrate that practice XYZ is possible and offer some insight and evidence as to why doing it one way (vs. another) is better.*
