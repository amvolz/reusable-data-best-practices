## Intended audience	

Educators at CTSAs who want to build a community of learners around their educational material, or make their educational materials discoverable and usable by others.

## Why this is important	

Keeping educational resources up to date and discoverable is difficult for single CTSA sites. In addition, sites replicating educational material that already exists is wasteful and largely ignores the possibility of building educational communities around such resources.

One alternative that exists is providing collective ownership, such as the model for [The Carpentries](http://carpentries.org/) (Software, Data, and Library Carpentry), or the [R for Data Science](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) learning community. Hundreds, if not thousands of educators have tested, honed, and improved the lesson material for these groups. This collective ownership of the learning material makes the material stronger and applicable to a wide range of learners. Additionally, the learning community that results from such collective ownership provides an opportunity for those with intermediate skills to improve their knowledge and practice in a safe environment. 

Additionally, making an educational resource discoverable is of vital importance. Discoverability may be done for multiple reasons: to advertise that an educational resource exists so others may take the course, or in the case of open educational resources, whether a course is appropriate to reuse, repurpose, or remix, and has additional resources so other instructors can adopt the material.

## Status and feedback mechanisms	

*What stage is it in the development process? (See options below). Description and links for how people can comment, or contribute -- whether via Google form or GitHub issue etc.*

## Takeaway List	

*A bulleted list of things you can read and implement (similar to top 10 PLoS Top 10 articles).*



## Deep dive into takeaways	

*Each item should include specific examples that demonstrate that practice XYZ is possible and offer some insight and evidence as to why doing it one way (vs. another) is better.*
